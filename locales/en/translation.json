    "body1": "I started smartmieter with a friend in Munich after we both ran into frustrating rental issues. Our goal was to make rental consultation as easy and accessible as possible ‚Äî helping tenants avoid exploitation and assert their rights.",
    "body2": "I was part of Deloitte‚Äôs 'Analytics Journey', a rotational program across all five of the firm's business units. My home unit was Financial Advisory ‚Äì specifically within Business & Transaction Services.",
    "body3": "Together with a university friend, I founded StylisAI to digitize the closet and offer a personal stylist experience through AI ‚Äî all from your phone.",
    "body4": "As an analytics intern at Porsche Digital in Atlanta, I worked with tools like Google Analytics and Python to generate insights into consumer behavior on various PDI platforms.",
    "time4": "Summer 2022",
    "expanded1": "I started smartmieter with a friend in Munich after both of us dealt with unfair rental situations. We wanted to make legal rental support both accessible and scalable. We founded smartmieter as a UG, allowing users to upload rental contracts and service charge bills for an AI-powered legal check and initial consultation. The platform then steps in on behalf of the renter to communicate with landlords ‚Äî whether to resolve issues or negotiate rent reductions until problems are addressed. We built it using the OpenAI API, React, JSX, and other tools, collaborating entirely over GitHub. Try it out here:",
    "example1": "Business Planning",
    "example2": "and many more...",
    "expanded2": "At Deloitte, I rotated through multiple units as part of the Analytics Journey, with Financial Advisory as my home base. I contributed to several projects, including an anonymization tool using local AI to process sensitive client data, and a customs classification tool that automated tax-relevant labeling of imported items. These solutions helped save analysts hours of manual effort. Outside of projects, I also took part in networking events and internal initiatives like the Deloitte hackathon, where my team won 'Best Business Pitch'. I later decided to leave Deloitte to focus full-time on smartmieter.",
    "example3": "Git functions",
    "expanded3": "StylisAI ‚Äî later called Finish my Fit ‚Äî was a project I co-founded with a university friend. We set out to digitize the wardrobe and give users access to a personal stylist powered by AI. We used the OpenAI API and built features with React, HTML, and Python. Along the way, we learned a lot about venture capital, pitching, and shaping a compelling business model.",
    "expanded4": "While interning at Porsche Digital in Atlanta, I used Python and Google Analytics to better understand how users interact with PDI platforms. One key project involved cleaning and analyzing chat logs from a support bot used by Porsche customers. By identifying recurring pain points and the bot‚Äôs weak spots, I offered recommendations for improvement and helped evaluate whether the contract with the provider should be renewed.",
