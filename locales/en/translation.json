We wanted to make rental consultation as easy an accessible as possible, ensuring renters aren't exploited - and receive the rights they are entitled to. We founded smartmieter as a UG in Munich, and allow customers to upload rental contracts and service charge bills,  to check for legality, as well as receive initial consultation via AI about their rental situation or issues. Smartmieter then takes over the communication on behalf of the renter with their landlord, and aims to fulfill the renters goals (whether that be solving the issue in the rental or obtaining reduced rent until the problem is solved). We did this via the OpenAI API, react, jsx, amongst other functionalities over github. Try it out here:",

One example was an anonymizing function, utilizing local AI, which allowed us to process sensitive data while maintaining confidentiality in client data. I also participated in networking and program initiatives, like a Deloitte hackathon, in which my team won 'best business pitch'.",

On one occasion, I cleaned up a database of chatlogs with a support bot, aiming to assist Porsche customers with their vehicles.I identified common issues that customers were facing, and in what areas the bot was succeeding or failing. As a result, I identified ways to improve the bot, and gave insight on whether or not it was worth maintaining the contract with the support bot company.",
